# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ – Daily Practice

Welcome to my daily DSA grind using **“Data Structures and Algorithms in C++” by Adam Drozdek**.  
This repository documents my journey to mastering foundational and advanced algorithms in C++, one concept at a time.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a strong understanding of data structures and algorithms through:

- Daily hands-on practice
- Clean C++ implementations
- Consistent commitment
- Building a strong foundation for interviews, coding challenges, and real-world problem solving

---

## 🔥 Daily Commitment

- 📖 Read 1 topic or section from the book
- 🧠 Understand and summarize key ideas
- 💻 Implement the concept in C++
- 🗒️ Add comments, notes, and examples
- ✅ Push at least one commit daily

This is part of my personal **#AttackMode** — discipline, no shortcuts.
