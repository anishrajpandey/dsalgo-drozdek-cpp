# 📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ – Daily Practice

Welcome to my personal journey of mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **“Data Structures and Algorithms in C++” by Adam Drozdek**.  
This repository is my daily log, practice space, and a commitment to consistency and growth as a Computer Science student.

## 🎯 Goal

To deeply understand core data structures and algorithms in C++ through **daily coding, note-taking, and reflection**, with the ultimate goal of becoming interview-ready and academically sharp.

---

## 🔥 Daily Commitment

- ✅ Study one concept or section from the book daily.
- ✅ Implement the concept/code in C++.
- ✅ Write clean, well-commented, readable code.
- ✅ Reflect in notes or add comments on key takeaways.
- ✅ Commit to this repo **every single day** — no zero days.

## ✨ Why I'm Doing This

As a CS undergrad from Nepal studying in the U.S., I want to:
- Build a rock-solid foundation in DSA.
- Level up my problem-solving and C++ skills.
- Prepare for coding interviews and advanced topics.
- Stay consistent and push myself through daily discipline.

This is **#AttackMode** — no shortcuts, just grind. 💪
